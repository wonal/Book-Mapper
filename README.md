# Book-Mapper

Oh the places you'll read.

This is (will be) a web application designed to allow avid readers to generate a map of places they have traveled to via the books they have read.

Planned Book-Mapper features include:
- A lookup feature to find books and the respective locations where the narrative took place.
- An add feature to add a location for a particular book.
- Generate a map with pins, with each pin indicating the location of a book the user has read.

The initial version of Book-Mapper will be limited to books that have taken place on Earth, although hopefully this will be extended in the future for us science-fiction lovers.
